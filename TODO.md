TODO
====
* Make command to generate a translation file from the English.
* Stub out a GitHub page for the project.
* Clean up en.yaml, and add Spanish and Chinese in the cleaned-up format.
* Consider using "*_i18n" in JSON to signify internationalized text.
* Prioritize listing the offices as they appear in offices.json.
  - Different groupings and filters can happen later.
  - Come up with a DRY pattern to display each language labeled
    with the language name (try using a macro).
  - Also note when language is missing
  - Document the JSON objects as I go.
* Use resource files instead.
* Document Court of Appeals.
* Do Supreme Court.
* Mark partisan.
